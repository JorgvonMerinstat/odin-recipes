    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Lecsó is a popular dish in the Czech Republic, though it is often met with
      mixed feelings due to its association with school cafeterias. Despite
      this, lecsó is a tasty and versatile meal that combines peppers, tomatoes,
      and onions with a touch of paprika. This dish is enjoyed across Central
      Europe, where it is known for its simple, comforting flavors.
      Historically, lecsó has its roots in Hungarian cuisine, where it is known
      as "lecsó." It was traditionally a way to use up summer vegetables and is
      often served with bread or as a side dish to meats.
