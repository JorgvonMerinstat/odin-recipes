    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Butcher's Dish, known as "Katův šleh" in Czech, is a traditional Czech
      meal. The name "kat" translates to "executioner" in English, and "šleh"
      can mean "strike" or "whip," giving a colorful description of this hearty
      dish. The origin of the name is somewhat ambiguous, but it is believed
      that this dish was named humorously after the traditional butchery skills
      required to prepare it. This dish typically features a mixture of meat,
      onions, and spices, creating a flavorful and satisfying meal that has
      become a staple in Czech cuisine.
