    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Goulash is a very popular meal in my country - the Czech Republic. It has
      its origins in Hungary, where it is called pörkölt. While the Hungarian
      version is typically more of a stew with chunks of meat and vegetables,
      the Czech version is a thicker, heartier dish, often served with bread
      dumplings or fresh bread. The key ingredients include beef, onions,
      paprika, garlic, and various spices, which are slowly simmered to create a
      rich, flavorful sauce. Czech goulash is often enjoyed at family
      gatherings, pubs, and even special occasions, representing comfort food
      that warms both the body and soul.

    <h2>Ingredients (for 4-6 persons)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 kg of onions</li>
      <li>1 kg of pork Sank</li>
      <li>70 g of tomato paste</li>
      <li>1.25 l of beef broth</li>
      <li>5 pieces of big garlic cloves</li>
      <li>pork lard</li>
      <li>
        ground paprika (I recommend smoked paprika.), ground caraway, salt and
        ground pepper.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Chop the onion into small pieces.</li>
      <li>Cut the pork shank into medium-sized cubes.</li>
      <li>Allow the pork lard to melt in the pot.</li>
      <li>Sauté the onion in the lard until it is translucent.</li>
      <li>
        Now add the pork shank and allow the meat to brown, but not too much.
        (Stir thoroughly throughout the process to ensure the meat is coated
        with the onion.)
      </li>
      <li>
        When the meat is browned, sprinkle the entire mixture generously with
        paprika. Continue to stir to prevent the paprika from burning.
      </li>
      <li>
        When everything is well mixed, add the tomato paste and continue
        stirring.
      </li>
      <li>Pour the broth over the mixture so that everything is submerged.</li>
      <li>
        Cook for as long as possible, stirring occasionally and seasoning to
        taste. The goulash is ready when the meat begins to shred into fibers.
      </li>
      <li>Serve with bread dumplings and garnish the goulash on the plate with chopped onions.</li>
    </ol>
